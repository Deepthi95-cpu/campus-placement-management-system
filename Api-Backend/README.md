Explanation of Each Part
api-backend/config/db.js:

This file is responsible for setting up the connection to your database (e.g., MySQL). It uses a database URI defined in the .env file for a secure and flexible connection.
api-backend/controllers/:

AuthController.js: Contains functions like register() and login() for user authentication. The register function checks if the user already exists, hashes the password, and then stores the user in the database. The login function verifies the credentials, generates a JWT token, and sends it back.
FeedbackController.js: Manages the logic for submitting feedback. When a user sends feedback, it is stored in the database with a reference to the student's ID.
StudentController.js: Handles student data. It could contain functions to get all students, add a student, or delete a student, depending on your application needs.
api-backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js:

This file provides a middleware function that checks if the incoming request has a valid JWT token. If the token is valid, the middleware allows the request to proceed; if not, it sends a response with an authorization error.
api-backend/routes/:

authRoutes.js: Defines the routes related to user authentication, such as POST /register for registration and POST /login for login.
feedbackRoutes.js: Contains the route for submitting feedback (POST /submit).
studentRoutes.js: Contains routes related to student data, such as GET /students for retrieving all students.
api-backend/server.js:

This is the entry point of your backend application. It sets up the server, connects to the database, and links the defined routes to appropriate endpoints.
It also handles middleware (e.g., JWT authentication, CORS, parsing  requests).
api-backend/.env:

Stores environment variables like the database connection URI (DB_URI) and the JWT secret (JWT_SECRET). This way, sensitive information is not hardcoded in the code.
api-backend/uploads/:

This folder is meant to store uploaded files like resumes. For example, when a user submits a resume, the file would be saved here.
Key Components and Flow
Authentication Flow:

Register: A user sends a registration request to the POST /register route. The AuthController checks if the user exists and then saves the new user to the database after hashing the password.
Login: The user logs in by sending their credentials to POST /login. If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client.
JWT Middleware: Every subsequent request requiring authorization (like accessing protected routes) must include the JWT token in the headers. The authMiddleware.js will validate the token before proceeding to the requested route.
Student Data:

A client can request to see all students by sending a GET /students request. The StudentController retrieves the data and returns it to the client.
Feedback Submission:

Users (probably students) can submit feedback by sending a POST /submit request, which is handled by the FeedbackController. The feedback will be stored in the database, associated with the student's ID.
Example Database Schema
User Schema:
The User schema might include fields like username, email, and password. These are used for user authentication and storing user data securely.

Feedback Schema:
The Feedback schema would include a studentId (a reference to the Student model) and a feedbackText (the actual feedback submitted).

Student Schema:
The Student schema might contain name, email, and resume (the file path to the uploaded resume). The resume would be a link to the file stored in the uploads/ folder.

Security Considerations
Environment Variables:
Sensitive information like the database URI (DB_URI) and the JWT secret (JWT_SECRET) should be stored in the .env file and not in the codebase. This ensures that your sensitive data is kept safe.

JWT Authentication:
Using JWT for user authentication helps secure API endpoints and ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.




Below is an explanation of the dependencies and scripts included in your package. file for the campus-connect project:

Basic Information


{
  "name": "campus-connect",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "author": "",
  "type": "commonjs",
  "main": "server.js"
}
name: This is the name of your project or application. In this case, the project is called campus-connect.
version: The version of the app. This will be incremented with each release (e.g., 1.0.0).
description: A brief explanation of the project. You can fill this in later to describe the app's purpose.
license: The type of license under which the project is released. ISC is a permissive open-source license, similar to MIT.
author: The author or organization maintaining the project (this field is empty).
type: Defines the module system used. "commonjs" indicates that you're using CommonJS module syntax (require and module.exports).
main: Specifies the entry point of the app, which in this case is server.js. This is the file that will be executed when the app starts.
Scripts


"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "nodemon server.js"
}
test: A placeholder script for running tests. This script just outputs a message and exits because no tests have been defined yet.
start: This script uses nodemon to start your server. nodemon watches for file changes and restarts the server automatically during development. When you run npm start, it will execute nodemon server.js and start the application from the server.js file.
Dependencies
These are the external packages required by your project. They provide various features and functionalities, and here’s a breakdown of each one:

1. @google/generative-ai


"@google/generative-ai": "^0.21.0"
Purpose: This package is likely for using Google's Generative AI models. It could be used to integrate AI-based features into your application (like natural language processing or generating responses based on user input).
Why use it: If your project needs AI-based features such as text generation, this package helps integrate those capabilities easily with Google's cloud services.
2. bcryptjs


"bcryptjs": "^2.4.3"
Purpose: This is a library used for hashing passwords securely.
Why use it: When handling user authentication, storing passwords in plain text is a security risk. bcryptjs helps you hash passwords and verify them securely when users log in.
3. body-parser


"body-parser": "^1.20.3"
Purpose: This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your request handlers, making it easier to work with data from POST requests (like  or form data).
Why use it: body-parser helps to extract data from the body of requests (e.g., when a user submits a form). This is especially useful for processing the data sent in POST or PUT requests.
4. cookie-parser


"cookie-parser": "^1.4.7"
Purpose: This middleware parses cookies attached to the incoming request.
Why use it: Cookies are often used for session management (like remembering logged-in users). cookie-parser allows you to easily parse cookies and use them within your app.
5. cors


"cors": "^2.8.5"
Purpose: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows you to control which domains are allowed to access your backend.
Why use it: If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains (like localhost:3000 for the frontend and localhost:5000 for the backend), CORS ensures that your backend allows the frontend to make API requests without running into security errors.
6. dotenv


"dotenv": "^16.4.7"
Purpose: Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
Why use it: dotenv allows you to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other settings outside of your codebase in an .env file. This makes it more secure and easier to manage across different environments (development, production).
7. express


"express": "^4.21.2"
Purpose: Express is a web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of creating APIs and handling HTTP requests.
Why use it: Express is essential for building APIs, handling routing, middleware, and more. It's one of the most popular frameworks for building backend applications with Node.js.
8. jsonwebtoken


"jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
Purpose: This library is used for creating and verifying JWT ( Web Tokens).
Why use it: JWT is commonly used for handling authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, you can generate a JWT token that stores their user information, which can be sent along with each subsequent request for user validation.
9. multer


"multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1"
Purpose: This middleware is used for handling file uploads in Node.js.
Why use it: If your application needs to upload files (like resumes, images, or documents), multer makes it easy to handle file uploads by parsing multipart/form-data requests and storing files in your server or cloud storage.
10. mysql2


"mysql2": "^3.12.0"
Purpose: mysql2 is a MySQL client for Node.js, offering better performance and more features compared to the default mysql package.
Why use it: Since your project uses MySQL for database management, mysql2 allows you to connect to your MySQL database, perform queries, and use connection pooling.
11. nodemailer


"nodemailer": "^6.10.0"
Purpose: Nodemailer is used for sending emails from your Node.js application.
Why use it: If your application needs to send email notifications (e.g., user registration confirmation, password reset), nodemailer helps you easily send emails via SMTP.
12. nodemon


"nodemon": "^3.1.9"
Purpose: Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your server whenever it detects changes to the source code.
Why use it: This is useful during development, as you don't have to manually stop and restart the server every time you change the code. It speeds up the development process by automatically applying code changes.
